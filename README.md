# Next.js 15: `getServerSideProps` API Fetch Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in Next.js 15 applications when fetching data within `getServerSideProps` using `async/await`.  The problem arises from insufficient error handling when API requests fail, resulting in unhelpful 500 errors or blank pages for the user.

## The Problem

The provided `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where a `fetch` request to an external API might fail.  The existing `try...catch` block, while attempting to handle errors, doesn't provide enough information to the user or facilitate proper debugging, especially if error handling is complex and nested.  This makes it difficult to identify the root cause of the API failure.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` provides an improved approach.  The solution incorporates more robust error handling by checking the response status and providing more specific error messages. It also implements custom error pages for a better user experience and logging for debugging.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Observe the blank page or 500 error when the API request fails.  Compare the behavior with the solution.
